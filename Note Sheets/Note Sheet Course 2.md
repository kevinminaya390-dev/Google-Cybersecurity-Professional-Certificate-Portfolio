# Course 2 Glossary – Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

This glossary contains key terms from **Course 2** of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, explained simply with real-world examples for easier understanding.

---

## A
**Assess** – The fifth step of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), where you check if security controls are working as intended.  
*Example:* Testing firewalls to ensure they block unauthorized traffic.

**Asset** – Anything valuable to an organization.  
*Example:* Company laptops, customer data.

**Attack vectors** – The paths attackers use to get into systems.  
*Example:* Phishing emails, unsecured Wi-Fi.

**Authentication** – Verifying someone’s identity.  
*Example:* Logging in with a username and password.

**Authorization** – Deciding what resources a person can access.  
*Example:* Giving HR staff access to payroll data but not to server configurations.

**Authorize** – The sixth step of the NIST RMF, where you take responsibility for the risks that remain after implementing controls.

**Availability** – Ensuring data is accessible to authorized people when needed.  
*Example:* Keeping a website online during high traffic.

---

## B
**Biometrics** – Using unique physical traits for authentication.  
*Example:* Fingerprint or facial recognition login.

**Business continuity** – Keeping operations running during disruptions.  
*Example:* Having a backup office location ready after a disaster.

---

## C
**Categorize** – The second step of the NIST RMF, where you identify and classify systems based on their security needs.

**Chronicle** – A cloud-based tool to store, search, and analyze security data.

**Confidentiality** – Ensuring only authorized people can see specific data.  
*Example:* Encrypting sensitive files.

**CIA triad** – The three pillars of security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

---

## D
**Detect** – A NIST core function focused on identifying security incidents quickly.  
*Example:* Using an intrusion detection system (IDS).

---

## E
**Encryption** – Converting readable data into an unreadable format.  
*Example:* HTTPS encryption for secure web browsing.

**External threat** – Risks from outside the organization.  
*Example:* Hackers or competitors.

---

## I
**Identify** – A NIST core function to understand risks to systems, assets, and data.

**Implement** – The fourth step of the NIST RMF, where you put security and privacy plans into action.

**Incident response** – Steps taken to contain and recover from a security breach.

**Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and trustworthy.  
*Example:* Digital signatures on documents.

**Internal threat** – Risks from inside the organization.  
*Example:* A disgruntled employee leaking data.

---

## L
**Log** – A record of system events.  
*Example:* Login attempts stored for review.

---

## M
**Metrics** – Measurements used to track performance.  
*Example:* Average response time to security incidents.

**Monitor** – The seventh step of the NIST RMF, where you continuously check system security.

---

## N
**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – Best practices and guidelines for managing cyber risk.

**NIST Special Publication 800-53** – U.S. government standards for securing information systems.

---

## O
**OWASP** – An organization focused on improving software security.

**Operating system (OS)** – The main software managing hardware and user interaction.  
*Example:* Windows, macOS, Linux.

---

## P
**Playbook** – A guide detailing how to respond to certain security situations.

**Prepare** – The first step of the NIST RMF, focused on readiness before incidents occur.

**Protect** – A NIST core function for preventing security issues using tools, training, and policies.

---

## R
**Ransomware** – Malware that locks or encrypts files until a ransom is paid.

**Recover** – A NIST core function for restoring systems after an incident.

**Respond** – A NIST core function for containing and handling security incidents.

**Risk** – Anything that could impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

**Risk mitigation** – Steps to reduce the impact of risks.  
*Example:* Installing patches to fix vulnerabilities.

---

## S
**Security audit** – A review of security measures compared to standards or regulations.

**Security controls** – Tools and processes that reduce risks.  
*Example:* Firewalls.

**Security frameworks** – Structured guidelines for managing risks.

**SIEM** – Software that collects and analyzes logs for threat detection.

**SOAR** – Tools that automate responses to security incidents.

**Security posture** – An organization’s overall security readiness.

**Select** – The third step of the NIST RMF, where you choose and document security controls.

**Shared responsibility** – Everyone in the organization plays a role in security.

**Social engineering** – Tricking people into revealing information or giving access.

**Splunk Cloud** – A cloud-based log management and analysis tool.

**Splunk Enterprise** – An on-premises version of Splunk for real-time security monitoring.

---

## T
**Threat** – Anything that could cause harm to assets.

---

## V
**Vulnerability** – A weakness that attackers could exploit.
