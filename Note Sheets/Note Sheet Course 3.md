- **Internet Protocol (IP)**: Standards for routing and addressing data packets.  
- **IP address**: Unique string identifying the location of a device on the internet.  
  - *Example: Your home computer might have a private IP like `192.168.1.15`.*  
- **IP spoofing**: Changing the source IP of a packet to impersonate an authorized system.  

## L
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network that spans small areas (home, school, office).  
  - *Example: All the devices connected to your home Wi-Fi are part of your LAN.*  

## M
- **MAC address**: A unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to a network device.  
- **Modem**: Connects a router to the internet.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requires two or more identity verifications for access.  
  - *Example: Logging in with a password *and* a one-time code sent to your phone.*  

## N
- **Network**: A group of connected devices.  
- **Network log analysis**: Examining network logs to identify events of interest.  
- **Network protocols**: Rules that define how data is structured and delivered between devices.  
- **Network segmentation**: Dividing a network into smaller segments for security.  
  - *Example: A company separates its HR systems from its customer database into different subnets.*  

## O
- **Operating System (OS)**: The interface between computer hardware and the user.

## U
- **Uncontrolled zone**: Portion of the network outside the organization.
